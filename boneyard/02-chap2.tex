\section{Data}\label{data}}

Census data is stored by table, year, geography, and survey. Each survey
has a different set of surveys, and surveys can differ from year to year
{[}@UnderstandingACSBasics2020{]}. Surveys are only available for
specific geographies, with broader, less frequent surveys covering a
greater variety of geographies. Geographies include states, counties,
census tracts, and school districts {[}@GeographicAreasCovered2020{]}.

The majority of my independent variables were sourced from the census
Annual Community Survey. The Annual Community Survey, or ACS, ``provides
a detailed portrait of the social, economic, housing, and demographic
characteristics of America's communities''
{[}@UnderstandingACSBasics2020{]}. ACS data is available on a geographic
hierarchy, going from census tracts to the United States as a whole.
This thesis uses ACS data aggregated at the county level from the
one-year survey {[}@GeographicAreasCovered2020{]}. Due to changes in the
way that ACS data was collected in 2010, the dataset includes ACS data
from the years 2012 to 2018. Tables are not necessarily consistent
between years {[}@UnderstandingACSBasics2020{]}.

The variables ``DeathRateCDC'' and ``UrbanRural'' come from CDC data.
They are sourced from the ``Drug Poisoning Mortality by County''
dataset, which is published by the National Center for Health
Statistics. The death rate is age-adjusted. The data was paired with the
census and overdose data using the FIPS code, which is a GEOID
{[}@calgaryNCHSDrugPoisoning{]}.

\hypertarget{sample-size}{%
\subsection{Sample Size}\label{sample-size}}

Unfortunately, not all counties in Ohio are included in the Annual
Community Survey. Only counties with a population of 65,000 or greater
are included in the one year Annual Community Survey
{[}@GeographicAreasCovered2020{]}. In total, the sample includes 39 out
of Ohio's 88 counties. Since the census data is censored based on county
population, there is selection bias in the sample. This means that my
results may be an inaccurate reflection of reality if there is
correlation between a county's population and the county's fatal drug
overdose rate. Given that the literature suggests that rural areas have
suffered from greater increases in overdose rates, it is likely that
there is correlation between county population and the overdose rate,
meaning that there is likely selection bias in the dataset.

Counties excluded in the one year Annual Community Survey are available
in other U.S. Census Bureau datasets. Counties with at least a
population of 20,000 are included in the one year Annual Community
Survey supplemental estimates, which provide a more limited version of
the tables included in the broader one year Annual Community Survey.
Furthermore, the ACS five year estimates include many counties excluded
from the one-year estimates, and the decennial survey includes all areas
{[}@UnderstandingACSBasics2020{]}.

\subsection{Variable Summary
Statistics}\label{variable-summary-statistics}}

For the education variables, ``\emph{b}'' refers to big bins
(e.g.~college or more, high school or less), while ``\emph{s}'' refers
to small bins (e.g.~some college, college, graduate school). The big
bins are calculated by aggregating the smaller bins, and exclude
individuals with some amount of college education but less than a
bachelors-level degree. The original data was provided as a raw count
for each education level (i.e.~number of people with an 11th grade
education, number of people with a 12th grade education, and so on). To
convert it into percentages, I divided each raw count by the total
population of the county and assumed that all individuals would be
included in one--and only one--column.

Race is included as the variable ``percent\_black''. Racial demographic
data is represented this way because census demographic data that
distinguishes between cacausian and latinx is significantly more
challenging to work with, as the categories provided do not neatly add
up the total population of the county. Since heroin was considered an
urban black drug from the late 1930s until recently, ``percent\_black''
seemed an effective enough variable for assesing the role of race in
drug overdose rates {[}@macyDopesickDealersDoctors2018;
@quinonesDreamlandTrueTale2016; @whiteSlayingDragonHistory1998{]}.

Disability is broken into age and sex bins. These bins are kept small
because in order to aggregate them, I would need each county-year pair's
population broken down into age and sex bins. The type of disability was
ignored, as the literature suggested that painful, physical disabilities
would have the greatest impact, and the census-provided disability bins
only seperated out deafness and blindness.

The majority of variables are in percentage form. These variables,
excluding ``OD\_rate'', have the term ``percentage'' in their name.
Percentages are calculated using the raw population for that year, and
are stored in the format XX.X\%, rather than .XXX\%. Percentage, or per
capita, form is used to isolate the role of county population on the
fatal drug overdose rate.

The distribution of the fatal drug overdose rate between counties
suggests that censoring is occuring from the bottom. This is because the
right-side tail is significantly longer and fatter than the left-side
tail {[}@hareThesisMeetings2019{]}.

Let's draw some maps.

The yellow county is Cuyahoga County, which contains the city of
Cleveland. Before the 1990s, Cleveland was considered to be the only
region in Ohio to contain a significant heroin market
{[}@quinonesDreamlandTrueTale2016{]}. Therefore, we would expect
Cleveland to have started off with an above average drug overdose death
rate. With the rise of the Xalisco boys and the introduction of
OxyContin, heroin markets spread across the state
{[}@macyDopesickDealersDoctors2018; @quinonesDreamlandTrueTale2016{]}.
Hence, we would expect Cleveland, and therefore Cuyahoga County, to have
a higher than average overdose rate prior to the mid 90s, and for other
counties to have a larger increase in their overdose death rate.

\section{Methods}\label{methods}}

I used the R package Tidycensus to download census data. Tidycensus was
created by Kyle Walker and is maintained by a community on GitHub.
Tidycensus allows ``R users to return Census and ACS data as
tidyverse-ready data frames, and optionally returns a list-column with
feature geometry for many geographies''. The ``list-column with feature
geometry'' allows the R user to easily draw maps using the downloaded
census data and a ggplot2 one-liner. Dataframes can be downloaded in
either a wide or tidy format, and brief descriptions of each variable
are available. The package is an API wrapper for data.census.gov, and
the API calls it creates can be accessed and manually ran using packages
such as rvest {[}@walkerTidycensus{]}.

In order to better use Tidycensus, I wrote custom functions to
accomplish several repeated tasks. One set of functions allows the user
to download multiple years of a particular census table at once. The
functions accept a table code and year range, and download the table for
each year, pivot it into a wide format, add a year column, and bind the
rows of the resulting dataframes into one master dataframe, which is
returned. Another function modifies the ``county'' column, removing the
string ``County, Ohio'' from each entry in order to make it easier to
join with other datasets.

Census tables were identified through several means. Using Tidycensus's
``load\_variables'' function, I created a dataframe of all variables
covered in the package and filtered it using keywords and R's grep
wrapper. Keywords were selected by brainstorming off of the hypothesis
that the literature put forward. For example, I used the keyword
``disability'' for the disability variables, ``median income'' and
``average income'' and ``mean income'' for income, and so on.
Furthermore, Reed's data services librarian, Mahria Lebow, helped me
identify relevant census tables by examining the census table shells and
going through the documentation available at data.census.gov
{[}@lebowCensusHelp{]}. I decided to start off with one year Annual
Community Survey data because it had a relatively limited number of
variables, making it easier to work with, and it provided more
statistical power than relying on the decennial survey, which at best
offered three rows per county (1990, 2000, 2010).

Plots, graphs, and maps that appear within this thesis were produced
using ggplot2 unless otherwise noted. ggplot2 is a R package that is
part of the Tidyverse universe of R packages. The package allows for a R
user to quickly produce aesthetically appealing graphs and maps using
any tidy dataset. Visualizations made in ggplot2 are designed using a
standardized ``grammar of graphics'', which helps keep the visual
appearance of a variety of different types of visualizations consistent
{[}@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016{]}. One major advantage of working
with Tidyverse-compliant packages such as ggplot2 and Tidycensus is that
they are designed to work together easily. This allows a R user to go
directly from pulling down census data to making maps without having to
reshape data or otherwise perform tedious data cleaning, wrangling, and
preparation tasks {[}@walkerTidycensus2020;
@wickhamGgplot2ElegantGraphics2016{]}.

Initial regressions were performed using simple linear regression.

In addition to the simple linear regression models, a model with a
censored dependent variable is also used. This model, referred to as a
Tobit model, is used when there is censoring of the dependent variable
{[}@hareThesisMeetings2019{]}. Censoring is when all values above or
below a particular value are recorded as one value. For example, income
data where all incomes over \$100,000 a year are coded as \$100,000 is
censored from above.
