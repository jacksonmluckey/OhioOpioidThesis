# Conclusion {-}

The current opioid epidemic is the worst substance abuse epidemic in US history. Opioids are both uniquely effective at treating pain and uniquely addictive among substances of abuse. While opioid abuse has a variety of negative health effects, the largest problem with its usage is overdosing, in which an excessive quantity of opioids causes the user's respiratory system to shut down, leading to death. With synthetic opioids such as Fentanyl, death can come in as little as two minutes after consumption. Deaths from opioid overdoses kill more Americans each year than car crashes, gun violence, or HIV/AIDS did at its peak. In this thesis, I examined the economic and demographic determinants of the fatal opioid overdose rate in counties in Ohio.

The results find that the overdose death rate is higher in counties with lower education levels, a higher percentage of people of color, a higher percentage of disabled older women, and either very high or very low population density. Overdose deaths are less common in counties with a high level of middle-aged disabled men and in medium density areas. These results are useful for targeting resources such as naloxone distribution and treatment programs that include MAT towards communities and individuals that will benefit from them most. In particular, they indicate that policymakers have been overlooking women as victims of the opioid epidemic, and should focus on bringing them into prevention and treatment programs. My future work on the HEALing communities study at RTI will help clarify which programs are the most effective, and which communities they can help the most.
