```{r}
lm(OD_rate ~ disability_percent_5to17_male + disability_percent_18to34_male + disability_percent_35to64_male, df) %>%
  summary()
```

As predicted in the literature, disability rates among 18 to 34 year old men do help explain OD rates

```{r}
lm(OD_rate ~ income_pc_individual, df) %>%
  summary()
```

On its own, income per capita for individuals with reported income does not help explain the variations in OD rates.
