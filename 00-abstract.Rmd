The United States is currently suffering from a severe opioid addiction epidemic that kills more people than car crashes, HIV/AIDS, or gun violence. This thesis examines the impact of economic and demographic factors on the opioid overdose death rate of counties in Ohio. I find that while most indicators are fairly ambigious, the disability rate among females aged 35 to 64 is positively correlated with the fatal overdose rate, whereas the same disability rate with males has a protective effect. Furthermore, medium density areas have the lowest rates. These findings are important for addressing the root causes of the epidemic, and can help target resources towards those who would benefit from them the most.
