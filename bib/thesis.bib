  abstract = {Overdose deaths from prescription opioid pain relievers nearly quadrupled between 1999 and 2010, making this the worst drug overdose epidemic in U.S. history. In response, numerous supply-side interventions have aimed to limit access to opioids. However, these supply disruptions may have the unintended consequence of increasing the use of substitute drugs, including heroin. We study the consequences of one of the largest supply disruptions to date to abusable opioids--the introduction of an abuse-deterrent version of OxyContin in 2010. Our analysis exploits across state variation in exposure to the OxyContin reformulation. Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), we show that states with higher pre-2010 rates of OxyContin misuse experienced larger reductions in OxyContin misuse, permitting us to isolate consumer substitution responses. We estimate large differential increases in heroin deaths immediately after reformulation in states with the highest initial rates of OxyContin misuse. We find less evidence of differential reductions in overall opioid-related deaths, potentially due to substitution towards other opioids, including more harmful synthetic opioids such as fentanyl. Our results imply that a substantial share of the dramatic increase in heroin deaths since 2010 can be attributed to the reformulation of OxyContin.},

  abstract = {Background
Illicit fentanyl use has become wide spread in the US, causing high rates of overdose deaths among people who use drugs. This study describes patterns and perceptions of fentanyl exposure among opioid users in Rhode Island.
Methods
A mixed methods study was conducted via questionnaire with a convenience sample of 149 individuals using illicit opioids or misusing prescription opioids in Rhode Island between January and November 2016. Of these, 121 knew of fentanyl and reported known or suspected exposure to fentanyl in the past year. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with the first 47 participants.
Results
Study participants were predominantly male (64\%) and white (61\%). Demographic variables were similar across sample strata. Heroin was the most frequently reported drug of choice (72\%). Self-reported exposure to illicit fentanyl in the past year was common (50.4\%, n=61). In multivariate models, regular (at least weekly) heroin use was independently associated with known or suspected fentanyl exposure in the past year (adjusted prevalence ratio (APR)=4.07, 95\% CI: 1.24\textendash{}13.3, p=0.020). In interviews, users described fentanyl as unpleasant, potentially deadly, and to be avoided. Participants reporting fentanyl exposure routinely experienced or encountered non-fatal overdose. Heroin users reported limited ability to identify fentanyl in their drugs. Harm reduction strategies used to protect themselves from fentanyl exposure and overdose, included test hits, seeking prescription opioids in lieu of heroin, and seeking treatment with combination buprenorphine/naloxone. Participants were often unsuccessful in accessing structured treatment programs.
Conclusion
Among illicit opioid users in Rhode Island, known or suspected fentanyl exposure is common, yet demand for fentanyl is low. Fentanyl-contaminated drugs are generating user interest in effective risk mitigation strategies, including treatment. Responses to the fentanyl epidemic should be informed by the perceptions and experiences of local users. The rapid scale-up of buprenorphine/naloxone provision may slow the rate of fentanyl-involved overdose deaths.},

  abstract = {Building on our earlier research (Case and Deaton 2015), we
find that mortality and morbidity among white non-Hispanic Americans in
midlife since the turn of the century continued to climb through 2015. Additional
increases in drug overdoses, suicides, and alcohol-related liver mortality\textemdash{}
particularly among those with a high school degree or less\textemdash{}are responsible for
an overall increase in all-cause mortality among whites. We find marked dif-
ferences in mortality by race and education, with mortality among white non-
Hispanics (males and females) rising for those without a college degree, and
falling for those with a college degree. In contrast, mortality rates among blacks
and Hispanics have continued to fall, irrespective of educational attainment.
Mortality rates in comparably rich countries have continued their premillennial
fall at the rates that used to characterize the United States. Contemporaneous
levels of resources\textemdash{}particularly slowly growing, stagnant, and even declin-
ing incomes\textemdash{}cannot provide a comprehensive explanation for poor mortality
outcomes. We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative
disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next\textemdash{}in the labor market, in mar-
riage and child outcomes, and in health\textemdash{}is triggered by progressively worsen-
ing labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of
education. This account, which fits much of the data, has the profoundly nega-
tive implication that policies\textemdash{}even ones that successfully improve earnings
and jobs, or redistribute income\textemdash{}will take many years to reverse the increase
in mortality and morbidity, and that those in midlife now are likely to do worse
in old age than the current elderly. This is in contrast to accounts in which
resources affect health contemporaneously, so that those in midlife now can
expect to do better in old age as they receive Social Security and Medicare.
None of this, however, implies that there are no policy levers to be pulled. For
instance, reducing the overprescription of opioids should be an obvious target
for policymakers.},

  abstract = {Introduction
Given the relatively recent growth in access to heroin and a more permissive atmosphere surrounding its use, we hypothesized that an increasing number of persons with limited experience and tolerance to opioids would experiment with heroin as their first opioid rather than more common prescription opioid analgesics.
Methods
Individuals entering substance abuse treatment for an opioid use disorder in the period 2010\textendash{}2016 (N=5885) were asked about the specific opioid they first regularly used to get high. To limit long-term recall and survival bias, analyses was restricted to opioid initiation that occurred in the past ten years (2005\textendash{}2015).
Results
In 2005, only 8.7\% of opioid initiators started with heroin, but this sharply increased to 33.3\% (p{$<$}0.001) in 2015, with no evidence of stabilization. The use of commonly prescribed opioids, oxycodone and hydrocodone, dropped from 42.4\% and 42.3\% of opioid initiators, respectively, to 24.1\% and 27.8\% in 2015, such that heroin as an initiating opioid was now more frequently endorsed than prescription opioid analgesics.
Conclusions
Our data document that, as the most commonly prescribed opioids \textendash{} hydrocodone and oxycodone \textendash{} became less accessible due to supply-side interventions, the use of heroin as an initiating opioid has grown at an alarming rate. Given that opioid novices have limited tolerance to opioids, a slight imprecision in dosing inherent in heroin use is likely to be an important factor contributing to the growth in heroin-related over dose fatalities in recent years.},

Doctor-shopping for OC decreased 50\%. Overdose fatalities reported to the manufacturer decreased 65\%.

We first estimate models of the effect of per capita opioid prescription rates on employment-to-population ratios, instrumenting opioid prescriptions for younger ages using opioid prescriptions to the elderly. We find that the estimated effect of opioids on employment-to-population ratios is positive but small for women, while there is no relationship for men. We then estimate models of the effect of employment-to-population ratios on opioid prescription rates using a shift-share instrument, and find ambiguous results. Overall, our findings suggest that there is no simple causal relationship between economic conditions and the abuse of opioids. Therefore, while improving economic conditions in depressed areas is desirable for many reasons, it is unlikely on its own to curb the opioid epidemic.},

  abstract = {Community-based overdose prevention programs first emerged in the 1990's and are now the leading public health intervention for overdose. Key elements of these programs are overdose education and naloxone distribution to people who use opioids and their social networks. We review the evolution of naloxone programming through the heroin overdose era of the 1990's, the prescription opioid era of the 2000's, and the current overdose crisis stemming from the synthetic opioid era of illicitly manufactured fentanyl and its analogues in the 2010's. We present current challenges arising in this new era of synthetic opioids, including variable potency of illicit drugs due to erratic adulteration of the drug supply with synthetic opioids, potentially changing efficacy of standard naloxone formulations for overdose rescue, potentially shorter overdose response time, and reports of fentanyl exposure among people who use drugs but are opioid na{\"i}ve. Future directions for adapting naloxone programming to the dynamic opioid epidemic are proposed, including scale-up to new venues and social networks, new standards for post-overdose care, expansion of supervised drug consumption services, and integration of novel technologies to detect overdose and deliver naloxone.},

Low production costs encourage suppliers to ``cut'' heroin with the drug, particularly white powder heroin sold in the eastern United States.1 Fentanyl also appears as a prevalent active ingredient in counterfeit OxyContin (oxycodone) tablets. The result is that fentanyl plays a major role in rising mortality due to heroin or opioid overdose.

This paper argues that the increasing availability of prescription opioids may threaten heroin sellers' profit margin and force them to find alternative methods to compensate buyers in the event of a supply shock. We investigate the 2006 fentanyl overdose episode in New Jersey and argue that the introduction of non-pharmaceutical fentanyl, its spatial distribution, and the timing of overdose deaths may have been related to trends in heroin purity. Using medical examiner data, as well as data from the Drug Enforcement Administration, Office of Diversion Control on retail sales of prescription opioids in a negative binomial specification, we show that month-to-month fluctuations in heroin purity have a significant effect on fentanyl-related overdoses, particularly in those areas where prescription opioids are highly available.

  abstract = {Background: Drug overdose deaths in the United States increased from approximately 16,000 per year in 2001 to
41,000 per year in 2014. Although every US state witnessed an increase, the increases were much larger in some
states than others. There was also variation as a function of race and ethnicity. Non-Hispanic Whites accounted
for more than 80\% of the deaths, and in some states their rates were about ten times greater per capita than
Hispanics and Non-White rates. State and temporal differences provide an opportunity to evaluate explanations
of what is driving drug overdose deaths. In this report, we evaluate the degree to which state level variation in
opioid prescription rates and social-economic conditions explain state level variation in overdose death rates.
Methods and data: We used publicly available data from the Center for Disease Control (CDC), Bureau of Labor
Statistics (BLS), Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) and the Opportunity Insights project.
Results: Legally prescribed opioids, social capital and work force participation accounted for 53\textendash{}69\% of the
between-state variation in overdose deaths in Non-Hispanic Whites. Prescriptions and the two social economic
measures accounted for about the same amounts of unique variation, but shared variation among the three
independent variables was the strongest predictor of overdose deaths. Panel regression results of the year-to-year
changes in overdose deaths were similar. However, the pattern of correlations for Hispanics and Non-Whites was
quite different. Neither opioid prescriptions nor social capital were significant predictors of overdose deaths in
the between-state and between-year Hispanic and Non-White regression analyses.
Conclusions: Common variation in opioid prescriptions rates, social capital, and work force participation proved
the strongest predictor of drug overdose deaths in Non-Hispanic Whites. We discuss reasons why the same did
not hold for the Hispanic/Non-White population.},

Overdose circumstances and decedent characteristics were ascertained from medical examiner files. Toxicological reports provided quantification of fentanyl and metabolites. ArcGIS was used to map exact overdose locations. We compared fentanyl-associated with non-fentanyl overdose deaths using chi-square tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests. To identify overdose clusters, we used the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. {$<$}br{$><$}br{$>$}RESULTS: A total of 778 overdose deaths were observed during the study period. In total, 358 (46.0\%) were attributable to acute fentanyl intoxication, increasing from 84 (35.0\%) in 2014 to 138 (55.6\%) during the first nine months of 2016 (Mantel-Haenszel test for trend P{$<$}0.001). Compared to non-fentanyl overdoses, fentanyl overdose decedents were younger, more likely to have multiple drugs contribute to the death, and have evidence of injection drug use.

Harmful drugs are regulated according to classification systems that purport to relate to the harms and risks of each drug. However, the methodology and processes underlying classification systems are generally neither specified nor transparent, which reduces confidence in their accuracy and undermines health education messages. We developed and explored the feasibility of the use of a nine-category matrix of harm, with an expert delphic procedure, to assess the harms of a range of illicit drugs in an evidence-based fashion. We also included five legal drugs of misuse (alcohol, khat, solvents, alkyl nitrites, and tobacco) and one that has since been classified (ketamine) for reference. The process proved practicable, and yielded roughly similar scores and rankings of drug harm when used by two separate groups of experts. The ranking of drugs produced by our assessment of harm differed from those used by current regulatory systems. Our methodology offers a systematic framework and process that could be used by national and international regulatory bodies to assess the harm of current and future drugs of abuse.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The opioid crisis is a complex, multifaceted, and dynamic problem requiring a comprehensive strategy for dealing not just with the stock of addicted users who are at risk of overdosing, but also considering the flow of new initiates and escalators in abuse. We had a limited understanding of the best approaches for tackling these issues when it was a prescription opioid problem; our understanding of effective levers in the current situation is even more limited. In the past two years, substantial attention and funding has been given to efforts to expand naloxone distribution and access to substance abuse treatment, two very important components of a comprehensive strategy. Prior to this, supply-side interventions dominated the policy landscape. Initial conflicting evidence of the effectiveness of supply-side interventions and the ongoing rise in overdoses despite widespread adoption of such policies, has led to pessimism about the potential of supply-side strategies. Criticisms about these approaches when dealing with black markets further abound. Ignoring the supply side of the equation at this stage, however, particularly the potential reactions and innovation of suppliers in these markets, would be a mistake and could further generate unintended consequences to well-meaning demand reduction strategies just as they did with well-meaning supply-side strategies. We explain below how ignoring the motivation and innovation of suppliers, both in the legal or illicit market, got us to this point in the opioid crisis, and how ignoring their continuing role could be even more devastating.},

Meanwhile, a massive influx of black tar heroin--cheap, potent, and originating from one small county on Mexico's west coast, independent of any drug cartel--assaulted small towns and midsize cities across the country, driven by a brilliant, almost unbeatable marketing and distribution system.

  abstract = {In an effort to address the opioid epidemic, a majority of states have recently passed some version of a Naloxone Access Law (NAL) and/or a Good Samaritan Law (GSL). NALs allow lay persons to administer naloxone, which temporarily counteracts the effects of an opioid overdose; GSLs provide immunity from prosecution for drug possession to anyone who seeks medical assistance in the event of a drug overdose. This study is the first to examine the effect of these laws on opioid-related deaths. Using data from the National Vital Statistics System multiple cause-of-death mortality files for the period 1999-2014, we find that the adoption of a NAL is associated with a 9 to 11 percent reduction in opioid-related deaths. The estimated effect of GLSs on opioid-related deaths is of comparable magnitude, but not statistically significant at conventional levels. Finally, we find that neither NALs nor GSLs increase the recreational use of prescription painkillers.},

This study uses data from the Multiple Cause of Death Files to examine the extent to which increases in county-level drug mortality rates from 1999-2015 are due to ``deaths of despair'', measured here by deterioration in medium-run economic conditions, or if they instead are more likely to reflect changes in the ``drug environment'' in ways that present differential risks to population subgroups. A primary finding is that counties experiencing relative economic decline did experience higher growth in drug mortality than those with more robust growth, but the relationship is weak and mostly explained by confounding factors. In the preferred estimates, changes in economic conditions account for less than one-tenth of the rise in drug and opioid-involved mortality rates. The contribution of economic factors is even less when accounting for plausible selection on unobservables, with even a small amount of remaining confounding factors being sufficient to entirely eliminate the relationship. These results suggest that the ``deaths of despair'' framing, while provocative, is unlikely to explain the main sources of the fatal drug epidemic and that efforts to improve economic conditions in distressed locations, while desirable for other reasons, are not likely to yield significant reductions in drug mortality. Conversely, the risk of drug deaths varies systematically over time across population subgroups in ways that are consistent with an important role for the public health environment related to the availability and cost of drugs. Put succinctly, the fatal overdose epidemic is likely to primarily reflect drug problems rather than deaths of despair.},

Mean (SD) baseline opioid overdose rates per 100 000 were similar in exposed (0.9 [1.4]) and unexposed (1.0 [2.1]) counties. Automotive assembly plant closures were associated with statistically significant increases in opioid overdose mortality. Five years after a plant closure, mortality rates had increased by 8.6 opioid overdose deaths per 100 000 individuals (95\% CI, 2.6-14.6;\emph{P} = .006) in exposed counties compared with unexposed counties, an 85\% increase relative to the mortality rate of 12 deaths per 100 000 observed in unexposed counties at the same time point. In analyses stratified by age, sex, and race/ethnicity, the largest increases in opioid overdose mortality were observed among non-Hispanic white men aged 18 to 34 years (20.1 deaths per 100 000; 95\% CI, 8.8-31.3;\emph{P} = .001) and aged 35 to 65 years (12.8 deaths per 100 000; 95\% CI, 5.7-20.0;\emph{P} = .001).

  abstract = {Background

In the United States whites are more likely to misuse opioid pain relievers (OPRs) than blacks, and blacks are less likely to be prescribed OPRs than whites. Our objective is to determine whether racial discrimination in medical settings is protective for blacks against OPR misuse, thus mediating the black-white disparities in OPR misuse.



Methods

We used data from 3528 black and white adults in the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) study, an ongoing multi-site cohort. We employ causal mediation methods, with race (black vs white) as the exposure, lifetime discrimination in medical settings prior to year 2000 as the mediator, and OPR misuse after 2000 as the outcome.



Results

We found black participants were more likely to report discrimination in a medical setting (20.3\% vs 0.9\%) and less likely to report OPR misuse (5.8\% vs 8.0\%, OR = 0.71, 95\% CI = 0.55, 0.93, adjusted for covariates). Our mediation models suggest that when everyone is not discriminated against, the disparity is wider with black persons having even lower odds of reporting OPR misuse (OR = 0.63, 95\% CI = 0.45, 0.89) compared to their white counterparts, suggesting racial discrimination in medical settings is a risk factor for OPR misuse rather than protective.



Conclusions

These results suggest that racial discrimination in a medical setting is a risk factor for OPR misuse rather than being protective, and thus could not explain the seen black-white disparity in OPR misuse.},
